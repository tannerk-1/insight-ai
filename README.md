## ðŸ’¡ Project Overview

Insight AI is an AI-powered reteaching assistant designed to help students reinforce classroom learning. It allows students to ask questions and receive answers based only on material taught in class, which is uploaded by teachers. The system uses a fine-tuned Flan Large model for extractive question answering and a Streamlit interface for interaction.
